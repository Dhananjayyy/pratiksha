## On Stage & Live

There's something magical about performing live - the energy exchange between performer and audience creates moments that can't be replicated anywhere else. My live performances range from intimate acoustic sets at cozy caf√©s to full-band experiences at music venues and festivals.

Each performance is unique, as I love to adapt my setlist to match the mood of the space and the audience. I often share the stories behind my songs, creating a personal connection that turns listeners into friends by the end of the night. Whether it's just me and my guitar or performing with fellow musicians, my goal is always to create an authentic experience that resonates long after the last note.
