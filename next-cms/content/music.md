## Music & Expression

Music has always been my creative outlet and a perfect complement to my scientific work. I believe that the arts and sciences are more connected than most people realize - both require creativity, precision, and passion.

I regularly perform at local cafes and events, sharing both original compositions and interpretations of my favorite songs. These performances have become a meaningful way for me to connect with my community outside the laboratory.
