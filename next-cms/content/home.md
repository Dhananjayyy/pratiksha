## About Me

I'm Pratiksha, a passionate singer-songwriter based in the vibrant music scene of my city. My musical journey began at a young age, and has evolved into a lifelong love affair with melodies and lyrics. My unique sound blends elements of indie folk, soul, and contemporary pop, creating an intimate musical experience that resonates with listeners.

When I'm not performing at local cafes and music venues, I'm constantly creating and exploring new musical ideas. My friends describe me as warm, expressive, and always ready with a song that captures the moment perfectly.

## My Musical Journey

Music has always been my most authentic form of expression. From my early days of singing in local talent shows to now releasing my own singles and EPs, each step has been a beautiful chapter in my evolving story. I'm constantly exploring new sounds and collaborating with other artists who share my passion for authentic musical storytelling.
